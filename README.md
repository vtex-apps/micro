# Micro
A Micro FrontEnd Framework built around extensibility and multi tenancy.

## Core Principles
Micro is built with the following philosophy

### Extensibility
The front-end world evolves rapidly, and thus, Micro is not attached to an specific technology or stack. It is built around a plugin based structure where even core features, like React, routing or GraphQL, are not part of the core framework.

### Performance
Performance should always be a limiting factor. If a plugin is not performatic by nature, it should not take the `micro` name on it

### Micro FrontEnd
Teams should be able to develop components independently and then assemble it into a final product with `no-costs` abstractions

### Multi Tenancy
A Micro rendering server should be able to deliver multiple different Micro Projects in the same instance performatically and securely.

## Why building another framework ?
We started developing a Low Code React+GraphQL framework back in 2017. Many of the tools and concepts available today were only a dream back them. This made us invent the wheel and make some good and bad choices on all Micro's core principles. This lead us want to leverage all we've learned and reboot our Store Framework using modern tools. However, after an extensive research we've find out none of the available open source tools fit our needs. Below are the reasons why

### Gastby
At a first glance, Gastby was perfect for us. It had the performance minded way we needed. However, at VTEX we deal with thousands of merchants, each merchant having up to millions SKUs and building all those pages statically is a no go. Perhaps if Gatsby finds a way of dynamically generting pages we can move to it

### NextJS
NextJS was really similiar to what we needed. It had dynamically page generation via SSR (Server Side Rendering). However we could not find a way to serve multiple NextJS project's (with SSR) in the same server, breaking our multi tenancy principle

### Pika
Pika has the `deno` minded way we like. However, performance is REALLY important to us and we think es6 still have a long way to go before being usable in production. However, their development experience was what we needed and we are currently using their amazing services in development

After seen no solution was a perfect fit for us, we've decided to build our own, based on great ideas from
- Gatsby (Performance optimization and plugins)
- NextJS (Dynamicity, SSR and Static Pages Generation)
- Pika (Development experience and fast build times)
- Webpack (Bundling with performance budgets, tree shaking)
- @loadable/component (Future of react code splitting)
- React Router (Dynamic routing)
- Relay GraphQL (Cascading fetching and data masking problems)
- i18next (split translation files and fetch them as you go)

## What we've came out with
After many discussions, we've decided all our framework has do is to opnionate your project's lifecycle and which build tools should be used in each lifecycle. The configuration of such tools (webpack/babel) is done via plugins and all the core Micro framework knows is how to look after these plugins in your package.json's dependencies and run them. 

For instance. If you want to make a React app using Micro, you will need, at least, the `@vtex/micro-react` plugin. This plugin will actually fill the webpack/babel configuration with usable stuff for transpiling your code and putting it in a page. Using only the `@vtex/micro` won't make your React app renderable.

With this architecture, we hope to make a plugin based framework where new technology can be adopted incrementally. If you don't use a feature, say i18n, you don't get the bloatware that comes with it because, by desing, not even your build system knows about it. 

### How it Works
The core of the Micro framework is the `@vtex/micro` package. This package defines a Micro Project. Any Micro Project is composed of a `package.json` file containing the project's name, version, dependencies etc. 

There are four different types of Micro Projects:
1. Components
  - A project that contains a `/components` folder with `.tsx` files in it. This folder should be used for sharing front-end components across other Micro Projects
2. Pages
  - A project that contains a `/pages` folder with `.tsx` files in it. Files in this folder are *NOT* shareable across micro projects. Also, files in this folder main be served to the browser
3. Lib
  - A project that contains a `/lib` folder with `.ts` files in it. This should be used for sharing common logic across Micro Projects and front/back ends
4. Plugin
  - A project that contains a `/plugins` folder with `.ts` files in it. This folder allows you to hook up into the a Micro Project's lifecycle. Keep reading to understand what a Micro Project lifecycle is 

To operate a Micro Project, you need the `@vtex/micro-cli`. This cli gives you functionalities like packing Components, serving Pages, or adding Plugins

## Getting started
Micro is built around common tools like Webpack 4, Babel 7 and Yarn 2, so using packages from npm should not be a problem at all. Actually, if you use only packages from npm, Micro will behave similarly to a multi tenant ready NextJS/Gatsby.

To start a Micro project, just [start your usual yarn project](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/init)
```sh
yarn init
```

Add packages as usual (with `yarn add` etc etc). Also, add Micro's CLI so managing your project becomes easier

```sh
yarn add @vtex/micro-cli
```

Now, let's make this Project a little more Micro friendly. In your project's root folder, run

```sh
yarn micro setup
```

> Tip: You can run this command with a `--dry` option so the cli only prints the changes it will make to your project, instead of writting them

This command will setup your Project to behave like a Micro Project. 

That's all for now. 

### Sharing Components
Sharing components across Micro projects is really easy. Any file created on `/components` folder is automatically available to packages depending on your. Just make sure there is an `index.ts` re-exporing the desired components on your project's root folder

To use a component exported from another Micro Project, say `packageA@1.x`, just `yarn add componentsA@1.x` this package and use es6-like syntax to import it 
```ts
import { AwesomeComponent } from 'packageA'
```

To understand more on how this magic is done, please read the Micro Internals section

#### Serving Pages
Currently, there is a simple server in the `micro-server` package that is used for development. This server does not serves requests in a multi tenant way yet. We plan to release our production ready server called Render very soon. However, in the meanwhile using our toy server should be just fine. To serve a page, create a file inside the `/pages` folder and

```sh
yarn micro link
```

This should open a dev server with your page on it. To understand more about how pages are built, read Micro Internals section

#### Plugins
Plugins are a core concept in Micro. If you want to develop a plugin, keep reading. If you want to use a plugin, this is the right place.
First of all, choose a plugin. For example purposes, I will use a routing plugin called `@vtex/micro-react-router`. Plugins are a normal npm package, so let's add it to our project. On your project root's folder run
```sh
yarn add @vtex/micro-react-router
```

Now, we need to tell Micro that we want to use this plugin for certain lifecycles. To do so, open your project's package.json. Under the `micro` section (if there is no micro section run `yarn micro setup` in your project) add the following in plugins

```package.json
...
"micro": {
  "plugins": {
    "onRequest": [
      "@vtex/micro-react-router"
    ],
    "onAssemble": [
      "@vtex/micro-react-router"
    ]
  }
}
```

This tells Micro to use the `@vtex/micro-react-router` plugin on these lifecycles. Read more about lifecycles in their section

#### Libs
Sometimes we just want to have a folder to write and share pices of delightful functional code. Libs are for that. 

Other Micro projects can import your lib's folder code if you export it in your toplevel `index.ts`, but be carefull. You should only use lib-related code in either `/plugins` or `/lib` folder, using it on `/components` may harm your site's performance

## Repo Structure
All micro-related code is in the (yarn workspace)[https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/] `./packages` repo. Some cool feature are shown in `./examples` folder.

In `./packages` you can find `micro-cli`. This is a `Next.JS` like cli that provides a webpack builder along with a server for SSR. Also, this CLI allow you to develop Plugins and Pack your Micro Components

Also, inside `./packages` folder you can find `./micro`, a part of the framework containing some root packages.
Having these packages comming from a single dependency makes that all micro components use the same react/loadable versions generating homogeneous code
Also `./packages/micro` contains some usefull code for partial hydration

## Running Examples
Go to your favorite example in `./examples` folder and run 
```sh
yarn && yarn dev
```

This should generate the following terminal output

```
$ yarn && yarn build
yarn run v1.21.1
$ micro-cli --project .
ðŸ¦„ Welcome to micro

```

Just click on the url and check out the features

## Developing Micro CLI
Development of the Micro Framework CLI occurs in two steps, first, go to `./packages/micro-cli` and type
```sh
yarn watch
```

This will watch for changes in `.ts` files and output to transpiled files to `/dist` folder. 

To test the build, run the binary in a Micro Project. Micro projects can be found on `./packages/examples`

```sh
yarn start --project <path/to/example/micro/project>
```
